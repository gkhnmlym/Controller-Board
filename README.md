# Controller-Board

We designed the PCB board using Altium Designer. This PCB board features 10 sensor inputs, which are processed and sent to the processor using optocouplers. It also controls 3 stepper motors and drives 2 LEDs using N-channel MOSFETs. RS232 is used for communication, and we utilized the Atmega324PB as the processor. The project design and materials are included in the attached drawing. The visuals related to the drawing are as follows.
